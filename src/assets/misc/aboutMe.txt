"I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay (just kidding, I do not study). I used to game a lot when I was in school, trying to squeeze the most out of my 2G internet plans while my PC struggled to download those 'highly compressed PC games' of 700 megabytes. Yeah, I've moved on since then. It can get painfully boring after a while. I also enjoy taking breaks from it all and going out to have some fun with my friends. Exploring new places, listening to lovely music, and of course, YouTube are some of my favorite pastimes. Alright, that's enough for the placeholder. See you sometime!"
