 I am himanshu gangwal, I hail from Jaipur, Rajasthan.  As you might have guessed I love to create cool stuff, learn new skills,
sometimes it all feels like magic (not soo much when you have to get compliation errors in such a project). Its so fascinating 
that we can learn anything from the internet and be infinitely creative with it. Most of the resources I used for this website 
will be listed down below.

I really think that a lot of people try to make "Computer Science" intimidating, make stuff feel like, it requires some godly
intuition and infinite knowledge just to write a shit-like code, whereas all it needs is a little intrest and patience to bear with
and being comfortable with not knowing stuff... If you really like anything and love it with all you have you surely will be good at it ...
